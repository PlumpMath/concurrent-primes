concurrency: the composition of independently executing computations.  not the same as parallelism

(<! ch)       receiving from ch   out of channel

(>! ch val)  sending val to ch   into channel

channels are for communication and synchronization

(but there are buffered channels that don't have the synchronization piece)


"Don't communicatie by sharing memory; share memory by communicating"


Generator: fcn that returns a channel



Hickey

Good programs should be made of Processes and queues

Communicating Scala Objects - threads one-to-one

Channels are fundamentally blocking (during read and write)

First Class Channels
